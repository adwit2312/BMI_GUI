BMI GUI in Java

INPUT:
When the program is run, a GUI with a white background will pop up. The height and weight can be inputted by the user. The height must be in meters and the weight must be in kilograms.

OUTPUT:
A GUI with a white background will pop up and it will show a Header saying "BMI Calculator". There will be two input boxes where the user will need to input their height in meters and their weight in kilograms. Once the button saying "Calculate" is pressed, it will show a calculated BMI as well as what category the user is in. It will also show risks that are considered with that type of BMI category. To enter new measurements, the user can press the button "Clear" and it will remove all the existing information in all the text fields.

Example of the Program:

The user enters a height of 1.73 m and a weight of 66 kgs. When the "Calculate" button is pressed, it shows a result like this:

Your BMI = 22.052190183434128 kg/m^2
You are Normal weight - Least health problems
To clarify risk for each individual,
other factors such as lifestyle habits,
fitness level, and presence or absence of other health risk conditions also need to be considered.
